        Oggy is a fun-loving, blue cat who enjoys a peaceful life filled with watching TV and eating. However, his days
        are constantly interrupted by three mischievous cockroaches—Joey, Dee Dee, and Marky—who love to create chaos in
        his home. Despite their endless pranks, Oggy's clumsy yet determined attempts to outsmart them make every
        episode full of laughter and excitement.
